# Sass Defaults

Sass Defaults exists to begin versioning and standardizing css styles accross apps. Sass Defaults does not fit nicely into an existing package manager and as such must be maintained and version in a github repository. Version numbers will be kept at the top of each file in comment form. When using this package you must download the code and paste it into the project you are working on.
